# pingo-drawing
experiment in platform indepent drawing in python
This was written in the 2000s using python 2.

It has a common API to do drawing support with backends to support PDF, the
reportlab PyArt library and the GD libary. It used an SVG inspired container
model for drawing. It was a branch off the piddle project.


### Notes
I'm keeping it for reference as I intermittently need to do 2D graphics
work. There is now a pypi project named pingo which is for manipulating pins on
small single board computers lke the raspberry pi, so don't be confused.
